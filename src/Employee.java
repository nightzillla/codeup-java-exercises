public class Employee {
//    Create an Employee class. The employee class should have a name instance variable, a static company variable set to Veridian Dynamics, and a non-static method displayEmployeeInfo(). displayEmployeeInfo() should generate a string, name + " works at " + company. Create a test class that instantiates three employee objects with different names. Run displayEmployeeInfo on all of them to show that each has access to the employee static variable. Bonus: write a method that has the employee emit a random quote and test it.

    public String name;

    public static String company = "Veridian Dynamics";

    public String displayEmployeeInfo(){
        return name + " works at " + company;
    }
