//    ================================= FILE IO MINI-EXERCISE
//- create a class called `FileIoPractice` with a main method
public static void main(String[] args) {

}
//- add a `fileIo` folder to the root of your codeup-java-exercises project.
//
//            - within this folder, add a text file, `people.txt`.
//
//            - add the following contents to the file:
//
//    Justin
//    Javier
//    Jason
//    Laura
//
//- write code in the main method that prints the following messages:
//
//            "Justin works at Codeup."
//            "Javier works at Codeup."
//            "Jason works at Codeup."
//            "Laura works at Codeup."
//
//            - create an array list of first names of four other people in your cohort
//
//- add code to your main method that replaces the contents of `people.txt` with your classmates by writing to the file
//
//- BONUS: create a static method, `deleteEntry`, that takes in the name of someone (a string) and when invoked, rewrites a new list to the `people.txt` file
//    with all entries except the passed in name
    }
