public class Quote {
//    Create a Quote class with a RandomQuote method. The method should generate a random number from 1 to 4. Depending on the result, the method should return a different quote. Now edit your animal class from the previous exercise so instead of an appropriate animal noise it makes a random quote. Test your animal class and verify that it now emits a random quote instead of an animal-appropriate noise.
