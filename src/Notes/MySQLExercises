Exercise Goals
Create users with different privileges
Log in as the users we've created to test and understand privileges
// creating new database CREATE DATABASE my_test_db;
// dropping database DROP DATABASE my_test_db;
// to see the list of users - SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
1. Log in to the MySQL server.
mysql.server start
mysql -u root -p
// enter pw
// List users - SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
// Dropping User - DROP USER 'joe'@'localhost';

2. Create a new user called joe that can log in from localhost. Give joe a memorable password. Do not grant any privileges to joe.
// CREATE USER 'joe'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

a. Use the query we gave you at the beginning of the lesson to make sure joe has been created and has a password.
mysql -u joe -p
b. Exit mysql and then connect again as joe.
exit
c. Try the same SELECT query again and see the results. What results are you getting? Why?
d. Log out from mysql and then reconnect again as root
mysql -u joe -p

3. Create a new user named anne. Give anne her own password
a. Grant all privileges to anne on mysql.user. Do not give her the ability to grant those privileges to others.
b. Exit, and then connect as anne.
c. Run the query to list all users from this lesson. Why does this work?
d. Create a user named sally and try to grant sally all permissions on the mysql.user table. Does this work?
e. Exit and reconnect as root.
