    // What is recursion?
    // A function that calls itself
    // What is a recursive problem? Or wht kinds of problems can recursion solve
    // A problem whose definition( or answer or solution) is expressed in smaller terms of itself
    // Note watch videos over recursion.

    // n factorial (or n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n

    // Analysis of an example: 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
    // What do you notice about the above description of 5!?
    // It can be rewritten as 5! = 5 x 4!, or 5 x 4 x 3!
    // Thus: n! = n x (n-1)!

    // Enter fibonacci
    // fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    // fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1

    // Write the recursive definition of an algorithm to find the minimum value in an array of ints
    // Express the definition as the 2 hallmarks
